# Wrathion Bug Tracker

This Bug tracker is a tool to report any issues, errors, bugs and broken mechanics from the Wrathion (WotLK Classic) realm.

# Report Template
When creating a bug report, be sure to name it accordingly ("[ROGUE] Blind doesn't work" instead of "rogue skill bugged"). Please follow the following template while creating a report:

**Description:**

Describe the bug you have encountered. Why do you think it's a bug?

**How to reproduce:**

Please explain what you did when you encountered the bug. What is your class, where were you when it occured. What can we do to reproduce the bug ourselves?

**How it should work:**

Please explain how should it work. Describe the expected behavior and back it with evidence, such as YouTube video / screenshot / comments from relevant date (when WotLK or WotLK classic was live on retail).

# When are you going to fix it?

We don't always fix bugs chronologically. Some bugs take more time to fix, while others take even as short as 2 minutes. Bugs are very often fixed based on severity, if there's a gamebreaking issue, we will make sure to fix it first.
